## What led you into design?

Building and organizing things. As a kid, I would disassemble every toy to look at how they were built, figuring out how to replicate and create new ones out of those pieces. I will then run and tell my parents about ‘my creations’.

I remember growing up with a computer, playing video games, running basic commands in DOS to execute those games, and I eventually got early access to the internet. That meant multiplayer games, and ultimately, clans that will need a communication channel, a website, an IRC channel, some forums, configuring gaming servers and whatnot.

That pushed me to become a ‘webmaster’, and I started to learn about HTML, CSS, PHP, FTP, and all the tools that will help me build more clan websites and the first freelance gigs for other random people I’d meet on IRC.

I spent a lot of years learning online– visiting forums, reading books, and at some point, I decided to skip university and focus 100% of my time on learning more about how to make better websites. That’s how I ended up taking my first job where I was a mix of a C# Developer and a designer building websites and desktop apps. I was 17 years old.

After a couple of years, I quit my first job to start a company called Erasmusu, and at some point, I decided to specialize in the part of the building the process I enjoyed the most: understanding the problem and designing solutions for it.

From there, I spent the last 14 years designing different digital products between Madrid, London, and now, from San Francisco. I worked for some companies such as Tuenti, Microsoft, and a bunch of startups.
